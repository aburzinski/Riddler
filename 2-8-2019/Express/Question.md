From Gary Anwyl, some Broadway math:

The song “Seasons of Love” from the musical “Rent” states that a year has 525,600 minutes. And, indeed, 365×24×60 = 525,600.

This, naturally, raises an abstract mathematical question: Given any three random integers — X, Y and Z — what are the chances that their product is divisible by 100?
