# Answer

No, you should not play against Monty!!

The three decks form a sort of Rock, Paper, Scissors triange, with each winning about 70 percent of the time against a good matchup.
- Red beats Blue about 70 percent of the time
- Blue beats Black about 70 percent of the time
- Black beats Red about 70 percent of the time

No matter which deck you choose first, Monty will have a 70 percent chance to win against you.
